  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-3 appear implemented via a global PwaInstallProvider (beforeinstallprompt handling) plus \"Install App\" entry points on SplashPage and in authenticated NavBar/Profile. REQ-2 appears mostly implemented via an InstallInstructionsDialog with platform tabs and copy-to-clipboard + toast confirmation. One acceptance-criteria item for REQ-2 (explicit fallback link to view instructions even when the native prompt is available) is not evidenced in the diff.",

      "requirement": "If the install prompt is available, the UI still offers a fallback link to view instructions.",
      "reason": "The new provider exposes openInstructions(), but the shown UI entry points (SplashPage/NavBar/Profile) call requestInstall() directly; there is no evidenced separate action/link/button that opens the instructions UI when canPromptInstall is true.",
