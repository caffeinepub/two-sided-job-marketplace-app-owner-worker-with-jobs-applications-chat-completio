  "summary": "Diff implements frontend support for collecting/saving/displaying phone number and for creating/displaying workersNeeded, and updates backend data models to include phoneNumber on UserProfile and workersNeeded on Job. A new backend migration module was added to backfill defaults for existing stored data. Some backend acceptance-criteria items (method signatures/validation/return payloads) are not directly verifiable from the truncated backend diff snippet.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest did not request adding a migration mechanism/module; it only requested adding new fields and wiring them through backend/frontend. This is additional implementation beyond the stated requirements (though plausibly needed).",
